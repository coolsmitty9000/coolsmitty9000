<p>
  I am a software developer, currently taking the Computer Programming and Analysis program offered at <b>St. Lawrence College</b> 
  <br />
  I started coding before highschool using <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYbK_tjZ2OrIZFBvU6CCMiA">Brackey's</a> tutorials on my own time. 
  But I was taught Java throughout highschool during my COMP-SCI classes, and that is how I discovered how much I enjoy programming and why I chose to pursue it as a career. 
</p>

  <i><b>I am currently focused on school, but I have some hobby projects I made before that aren't shown on my public repos: </b></i>
  <br />
    <li> I made a Discord bot to start a Minecraft server on my machine for my friends, since I wasn't always home to start it </li>
    <li> I made an aim trainer with JFrames, as I wanted to learn about those and how to get screen size & bounds</li>
    <li> I made a virtual deck of card that draws a random set of 4 cards in any given suit, then removes them <i>(mostly for practice with lists)</i></li>

  My friend <i>Sl0th-Silence</i> and I are making a program that scans game directories to provide a list of all installed games, although this is still in a planning stage. I'm hoping this turns out to be something interesting, but the development will take time
